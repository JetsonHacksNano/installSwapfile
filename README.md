# installSwapfile
<b><em>Note: While you can still use this method to add a swap file, note that </b>newer versions of L4T/JetPack have swap memory as part of the default distribution, implemented through zram. You may choose to use both a swapfile, as implemented here, and the zram swap memory at the same time.</em>

Install a swap file on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit. This should help with memory pressure issues.

### Setup Swap File
